[b]Version 3.7.*[/b]

[b]Shared Burden[/b] offers a new living standard that levels out the power of all classes - from worker to ruler. However, the amount of Unity generated by factions depends on political power... and thus factions in a Shared Burdens empire are actually less valuable. It increases Unity gain from the Egalitarian faction by 100% to compensate, but if you have another ethic that has high attraction (e.g. you mixed in Materialist for Fully Automated Luxury Space Communism), it's a net loss. This mod attempts to fix that:

[h1]Shared Burden Balancer[/h1]
Makes the following changes:
[list][*][b]+50% political power[/b] for all classes under Shared Burden living standard
[*][b]+50% political power[/b] for all classes under Utopian Abundance living standard
[*][b]-50% demotion time[/b] under Utopian Abundance living standard for Shared Burden empires[/list]
This should give a roughly equal amount of Unity generation under Shared Burdens, as well as making Utopian Abundance a straight upgrade for them. It should also help non-Shared Burdens empires avoid crashing their unity generation when they switch to Utopian Abundance.
